BASIC MATLAB FUNCTIONS AND PROGRAMS

1.	Prompts the user to enter a coefficient alpha and display the functions cos(x), +/- exp(-alpha*x), and cos(x)*exp(-alpha*x)
2.	Plots of step function
3.	Finds numerically the root the expression in the interval [0,5]
4.	Generates a vector based on user input, sorts it and presents the frequency of the 	elements along with the histogram.
5.	Generates a matrix and replaces the values of the matrix based on the random positions generated by the user input
6.	Sequentially turns on (turns off) the LEDs as you vary the resistance of the potentiometer on arduino
7.	Using Arduino and RGB Led for different colors based on user inputs
